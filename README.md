Dear NSF Leadership and Program Officers of the Graduate Research Fellowship Program,

We write to you as members of the scientific community concerned about the recent Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP) solicitation 20-587. Specifically, we are troubled by the identification of specific priority research areas:

*“[I]n FY2021, GRFP will emphasize three high priority research areas in alignment with NSF goals. These areas are Artificial Intelligence, Quantum Information Science, and Computationally Intensive Research. Applications are encouraged in all disciplines supported by NSF that incorporate these high priority research areas.”*

The GRFP is one of NSF’s most prestigious awards and has been the starting point for many of the US’s leading scientists. NSF’s stated purpose for the GRFP is to “help ensure the quality, vitality, and *diversity* of the scientific and engineering workforce of the United States.” We, the signatories to this letter believe in this purpose and the concomitant obligation to the highest standards for scientific merit, inclusion, equity, and diversity. **We are writing to you because this revision to the GRFP solicitation is both contrary to the program’s goals and harmful.**

### This revision amplifies existing inequity

The GRFP has already come under public scrutiny, with Science reporting that just 10 universities represented 31% of 2019 awards. [1] Preferring certain research areas will mean a movement away from the GRFP’s unique purpose in identifying and supporting the best scientists in any field and towards giving priority to one field over others. The change will also further contribute to the disproportionate awarding of the GRFP to students who attend schools with the most resources – a small handful of predominantly white, exclusionary undergraduate institutions. Contrary to the community’s request that NSF broaden participation in this program, **the proposed change will further limit the potential for applications and awards from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), and Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs).**

The consensus of research and reports funded or written by NSF, National Science Board, and the US National Academies of Science Engineering and Medicine [2-12] make it clear that underrepresented students, including people of color, women and gender minorities of all races, rural, first-generation, and low-income students have differential access and exposure to the areas now prioritized by the GRFP. **While we fully believe in the importance of computationally-driven technologies in the sciences, bringing this emphasis into the GRFP amplifies the digital divide**. In addition, emphasizing these research areas as the entry point to research careers may further disenfranchise students from underrepresented communities who are more susceptible to bias and data privacy abuses from AI/ML-driven technologies (and who therefore have heightened concerns about data privacy and bias). These students might be better served through culturally-sensitive exposure and training as undergraduates to allow them to develop informed agency in their decision making on these technologies.

Altogether, the revision sends a clearly exclusionary message and potentially adds to the problems noted in the 2014 evaluation of the GRFP (79.9% of fellows are white). [2] This disparity continues to be reflected on the list of GRFP alumni highlighted by NSF which features only three women and two persons of color. [13]

### Calling for equity and not a change in merit

**Commentators on social media and more than 3,000 people have signed a Change.org petition [14] calling for the removal of this revision.** Many expressed concerns that the revision imposes a new requirement and a barrier that they themselves could not have met as past trainees. The recent clarification via Twitter (see below) insufficiently addresses this concern. Only changing the solicitation text itself could partially remedy our concerns.

*NSF Tweet (July 28, 2020) [https://twitter.com/NSF/status/1288082834574409728](https://twitter.com/NSF/status/1288082834574409728)*

The issue of merit raised in the tweet is important. Newly suggested areas of emphasis may reduce application quality, as students try to craft their GRFP proposals to incorporate inappropriate or premature approaches.

### Equitable ways to improve GRFP


We strongly urge NSF to eliminate the preference for a narrow set of research areas (including revision 4 and elsewhere in the text) from the solicitation.

NSF has in recent years changed GRFP eligibility requirements to encourage a greater number of undergraduate applicants, [15]  but this has unfortunately only increased disparities in funding awardees. [1,16,17] The addition of priority areas runs counter to NSF’s effort to diversify and expand the applicant pool. **One of the GRFP’s greatest strengths is that it encourages trainees to develop their own research ideas pathways on the way to becoming independent investigators. This reflects NSF’s intent for GRFP of “investing in the person”.** Avoiding preferences for specific fields of science would allow the GRFP to better align with NSF’s basic research mission. Eliminating the preferences sends the message that all modes of investigation (computationally-intensive or not) have the promise of advancing knowledge.

Instead of reserving some of the GRFP awards for priority areas, we suggest that NSF instead build capacity in the US science and engineering workforce by creating complementary programs. For example, the GRFP could create opportunities for award recipients to develop computational skills similar to the Graduate Research Internship Program (GRIP) and Graduate Research Opportunities Worldwide (GROW) programs. NSF could also expand XSEDE access in undergraduate education. NSF could also consider adopting initiatives to address potential issues related to ethics of data policy, use, and stewardship at earlier stages of training, so that all students, not just GRFP applicants, could benefit from this global contextualization.

**We also encourage going above and beyond the high standard for NSF review by implementing a new level of transparency for the GRFP review process.** This could include additional training of panelists for cultural sensitivity and bias. Community input into a new review process for GRFP could better ensure the students selected reflect the diversity we aspire to see within science.

**There are many ways NSF can advance US research priorities without perpetuating disparities that exist for scholars at the beginning of their careers.** The co-authors and other signatories extend an offer to share community perspectives to continue to improve access and inclusion in the GRFP. We look forward to a revised GRFP solicitation from NSF that meets its vision for inclusive science in the US.

Currently, data is not collected on LGBT or sexual and gender minority (SGM) status by the NSF. A lack of data available prevents the status of these groups in STEM, which have been shown to be underrepresented especially at the undergraduate and graduate level, from being known. A recent supreme court ruling now provides legal precedent preventing discrimination in the workplace for LGBT and SGM identifying individuals. It is time for the NSF to begin collecting data on LGBT and SGM representation in STEM fields to better understand the status of these groups within their funding infrastructure. |

Hiring and tenure committees need to adopt alt metrics supporting data science before we ask even one more graduate student to sacrifice their career for it. Moreover, limiting grad student support to those who are already adopting these scientific approaches presumes that grad students enter their programs ready to do data science. Only the most privileged grad students are in that position. Let's keep moving in the right direction, but order the incentive structures so more people can succeed as academic data scientists.                                                                                                                             |

I learned the computational skills that would be required by this prioritization during my Fellowship not before I applied. It was not a direction that I highlighted in my application. If this prioritization existed then, I might not have been a Fellow and I might not have learned the skills that GRFP is now hoping to emphasize. The NSF is clearly working against its own goals and hindering diversity in science at the same time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

I had not yet received the training to know about, much less write a proprosal for, computationally intensive research. However, in my graduate training I have come to appreciate and rely heavily on the bioinformatic skills I've gained. The new GRFP research priorities are antithetical to it's purported mission and must be removed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Many students who are first generation or went to undergraduate institutions without strong research experiences for undergraduates may not know about the GRFP, or have any idea who to go about applying for one. Many of these students must get MS degrees in order to be competitive for PhD programs, and then are ineligible, or need a couple of years to figure out their project once they get to graduate school.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
